# Overview
After his last adventure, F!$% Boy has been trapped in limbo! The plane where
life, death, and ideas collide.

`Can't A Guy Escape Cyber-Limbo?` is the sequel to `Let a Girl Read`.
In it, you:
1. Control F!$% Boy, and company, on an RPG adventure!
    1. That means classic RPG controls: UP DOWN LEFT RIGHT to move, an INTERACT
    button and even a BACK button!
    2. Meet and talk to characters in so called "rooms".
    3. Fight characters in a turn-based manner in so callled "battles".

# Gameplay

# Graphics
Whatever I can muster up in MS Paint. These kinds of games are driven by their
writing and humour, not by their graphics.

However, F!$% boy got sent to cyber-limbo, so that gives me some hints:
1. Dark backgrounds with highlighted stuff in them.
2. Colorful character outlines.
3. Very few frames of animation (this actually has to do with a certain RPG
series of which the titles are anagrams for `NUTDEALER`)
