# 20_games_challenge
Personal repo of 20 games challenge for learning Godot: https://20_games_challenge.gitlab.io . You probably won't get much value from this just do the challenge yourself.

# Main Series
This is for small games which are completed and have all the stuff around them that makes them a normal game. This excluded learning exercises and library repository code.

## 01 Pong
I chose Pong for this one. This is the "design document" based on what I remember from Pong. It might be a little gucci.
### Requirements
 - [x] Player 1 is controlled by the up and down keys.
 - [x] Player 2 is controlled by a script which tries to match the paddle to the current position of the ball.
 - [x] When the ball passes either the left or right side of the screen, that player is given a point.
 - [x] Points are shown on screen.
 - [x] Points go up to 5, where that player wins with a nice little screen.
 - [x] The ball starts the match with a random amount of vertical momentum.
 - [x] The ball starts the match by choosing between starting with some fixed amount of horizontal momentum but in either left or right.
 - [x] The game doesn't start until some user interaction on the splash screen.

# W Series
Any thing that doesn't fit into the X or Y groups and is not a complete game.
## 052 Simple Ghost Platformer
An in-progress creation of a sidescrolling platformer controller.
I'm not super-interested in this so it's just going to be a testing ground for the time being.

# X Series
## X 01 Risk of Tanks
Combine an above-viewed tanks game with Risk of Rain's proc chain mechanic.

# Y Series
## Y 01 Inheritance Tester
This project tries to do some funky things with the node graph.

# Z Series - Libraries
This section contains library code fully fleshed out from any of the above sections. The goal is to move these into sub-repositories so they can be pulled independently.
