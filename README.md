Personal repo of 20 games challenge for learning Godot: https://20_games_challenge.gitlab.io . You probably won't get much value from this just do the challenge yourself.

# 01 Pong
I chose Pong for this one. This is the "design document" based on what I remember from Pong. It might be a little gucci.
## Requirements
 - [x] Player 1 is controlled by the up and down keys.
 - [x] Player 2 is controlled by a script which tries to match the paddle to the current position of the ball.
 - [x] When the ball passes either the left or right side of the screen, that player is given a point.
 - [x] Points are shown on screen.
 - [x] Points go up to 5, where that player wins with a nice little screen.
 - [x] The ball starts the match with a random amount of vertical momentum.
 - [x] The ball starts the match by choosing between starting with some fixed amount of horizontal momentum but in either left or right.
 - [x] The game doesn't start until some user interaction on the splash screen.
